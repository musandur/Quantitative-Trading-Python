In this work, we will build a 5-Day Mean Reversion alpha factor on a portfolio of 10 stocks using 10 years historical data, and evaluate it on different hodling periods. We denote this portfolio the universe as our trading strategy is built and statistically appreciated within this dataset. Portfolio and universe will be used interchangeably.

The selected stocks stand as the most traded stocks in average during the ten years considered; they also possed at least 8 years of trading data. 

The evaluation task is done with the alphalens library. 

Evaluation metrics include, expected forward returns, annualized Sharpe Ratio, information coefficient, Turnover, etc.
